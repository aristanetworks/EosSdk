/**
 * @file
 * The version module. It provides EosSdk version information.
 *
 * This module provides access to EosSdk version information, including
 * version major number, version minor number and version patch number.
 *
 * To access the version information, application will need to include
 * "eos/version.h", then it can access it directly, as following:
 *   eos::version_major
 *   eos::version_minor
 *   eos::version_patch
 *   eos::version
 *
 *   Note: eos::version is of type "char *" while version_major, version_minor
 *   and version_patch are of type "uint8_t".
