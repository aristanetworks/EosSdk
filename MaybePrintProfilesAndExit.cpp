// To facilitate the making of customized sysdb-mount-profiles (in place of the
// brute-force one "EosSdk", see /usr/lib/SysdbMountProfiles/EosSdkAll), an app can
// be started with the env var EOS_PRINT_PROFILES_AND_EXIT pointing to a filename
// where the profile should be written, then exit.
// We are not printing directly (prevents dups, agent name is only known late, some
// debug prints might interfere) so we first insert the profiles into a map.
// The collections of utilities we need for that purposes are defined here, under a
// static class in order not to overly pollute the eos space. They are declared in
// eos/inline/sdk.h.
//
// This code is included as a header file into both sdk.cpp and stubs/sdk.cpp

// env var is set, in which case it may actually be wrong -- we need basename(exe)).
